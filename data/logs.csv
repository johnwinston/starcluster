M1,34.98273,-87.1495491,12/31/22,9:10 PM,VG,3,15mm,Large faint smudge
M2,Lester,Lester,6/29/23,1:00 AM,VG,2.5,20mm,"Similar to M15. Circular, bright, compact cluster. Large. No resolvable stars"
M3*,Lester,Lester,3/29/23,11:15 PM,G,3,9mm,"Very bright, large, and generally circular. Mottled texture. Very rough. Emerging faint stars in and around the center and edge. Very rich. Almost like gravel or sand paper"
M4,Lester,Lester,6/17/23,10:40 PM,VG,4,15mm,Circular globular cluster. Does not seem very compact. Sparse set of stars of the same magnitude in the foreground w/ a cloudy circular dim background. The circular background seems to be same diameter as the perimeter
M5,Lester,Lester,5/24/23,10:45 PM,G,3,15mm,Large globular cluster. Dense and large compact core. Circular. A prominent star near the edge of the cluster. I double it is related. Upon futher inspection and consideration it seems clearly related. Many stars pepper the orbit of the core. Dandelion-esque
M6,Lester,Lester,6/24/23,10:20 PM,VG,3.5,20mm,A loose cluster of stars covering a large area in a 20mm eyepiece which become apparent in constrast to the surrounding darkness. Maybe 30 or 40 stars. Some faint in background. I can see the wings of the butterly
M7,Lester,Lester,6/24/23,10:25 PM,VG,3.5,20mm,Very similar to the Butterfly cluster. Takes up a larger area of the 20mm eyepiece. It almost covers the whole view. Obvious transition from the surrounding area to the cluster. The stars seem to be more of an even magnitude than the Butterfly cluster. A few stars of lower magnitude in the background. Very spread out and sparse.
M8*,Lester,Lester,6/24/23,11:00 PM,VG,3.5,20mm,A cloudy object next to a cluster of stars. The nebula is large and bright and reminds me of the Orion Nebula. The two objects compose an interesting picture. I wouldn't surprised if they were connected with the nebula producing the cluster. There seems to be a channel between the cluster and nebula. Some of the nebula on the other side of the channel. Interesting milky features. Two stars in core brightness of nebula.
M9,Lester,Lester,6/17/23,11:15 PM,VG,4,15mm,A large and bright globular cluster with a soft texture and faint stars peppering the perimeter. Irregularly shaped. Mainly circular. Seems somewhat compact but also seems irregularly shaped. I could be hallucinating.
M10,Lester,Lester,6/9/23,9:55 PM,VG,4,20mm,A warm ball. It's hard to make detail of the stars. Circular. There are a lot of stars way beyond the perimeter that seem to be a part of the system. It seems dense in the center with a very gradual release of a peppering of stars around the perimeter. Very large. Soft texture.
M11,Lester,Lester,6/27/23,11:15 PM,VG,3.5,20mm,A cluster of stars of low magnitude. It's interesting because they are almost all low magnitude but I can resolve a lot of them. There are a lot near the core. Maybe 50 to 100 stars. One brighter star near the middle. Circular. Barred mushroom shape.
M12*,Lester,Lester,6/9/23,9:40 PM,VG,4,20mm,"Very nice, irregularly shaped globular cluster. Odd arrangement of brighter stars around the perimeter. Almost looks like a globular cluster has been smacked in the face. A striking mixture of rough and smooth texture."
M13*,Lester,Lester,4/17/23,11:40 PM,G,4,15mm,"Extremely large and bright. Very rough. Focusing my eyesight reveals a large set of individual stars revealing an abnormal ""spider""-like shape. Loosely spread forefront stars with a glowing background suggesting a denser core."
M14,Lester,Lester,6/9/23,10:25 PM,VG,4,20mm,Circular. No individual stars that I can make out. Smooth texture. Large. Globular cluster
M15,Lester,Lester,6/29/23,12:55 AM,VG,2.5,20mm,"Circular, very bright, no individual stars. Extremely bright core that tapers off quickly. Compact, mottled maybe."
M16,Lester,Lester,6/26/23,11:30 PM,G,4,20mm,Honestly kind of underwhelming. I've spent a lot of time looking around for something else because it seems like a small star cluster to me. Any nebulosity could be imagined but comes from averted vision and allowing the view to go in and out of frame. Star cluster has maybe 20 or 30 stars of differing magnitudes.
M17*,Lester,Lester,6/26/23,11:35 PM,VG,3.5,20mm,"Very big, obvious nebula. It first strikes me as being very elongated. Sort of like a checkmark. Maybe some ravines going through it. A lot of stars around. Somewhat mottled. A star constrast at the bottom of the checkmark. Seems almost black. Big cloud of blackness. Maybe three sections."
M18,Lester,Lester,6/27/23,12:05 AM,VG,4,20mm,Barely in sight of the Omega nebula if this is even it. There are maybe a dozen stars. It's hard to even distinguish this cluster with up-coming star cloud. Barely stands out.
M19,Lester,Lester,6/17/23,11:10 PM,VG,4,15mm,"Very large and bright. Medium roughness, mottled globular cluster. Some stars resolvable near the center. Core seems to be very large."
M20,Lester,Lester,6/24/23,11:20 PM,VG,4,20mm,A large bright-ish cluster of general light. Initially I confused the lagoon nebula for M20. It's much smaller than the lagoon nebula. It still has a mini-lagoon in it.
M21,Lester,Lester,6/24/23,11:20 PM,VG,4,20mm,"Cluster of stars next to the ""mini-lagoon"" nebula. It's much farther out than the cluster of stars in the actual lagoon nebula. The stars look sparse but compact near the center. Reminds me of an eye of an iguana."
M22*,Lester,Lester,6/27/23,12:10 AM,VG,4,20mm,Very large globular cluster with resolvable stars. All of the resolvable stars are about the same magnitude. There is a nice glow of white light behind the stars. The stars seem to make an oval shape. Very large. Averted vision reveals more stars. Rough texture of the milky background. Maybe some ravines.Very nice
M23,Lester,Lester,6/26/23,11:45 PM,VG,3.5,20mm,A nice cluster of stars all of the same magnitude. None very bright. Some faint. Mostly all medium brightness. Evenly dispersed set of stars. Reminds me of a starfish shape.
M24*,Lester,Lester,6/26/23,11:50 PM,VG,3.5,20mm,Very awesome star field. I wish i had a higher mm eyepiece to see all of it at once. It is like an open cluster that spans the entire field of view. Milky white background. Very large. Wide. Thousands of stars
M25,Lester,Lester,6/26/23,11:35 PM,VG,3.5,20mm,Cluster of stars with some very close stars near the center. I can make out six very close stars around the same magnitude. Some brighter outliers scattered around. Kind of loose. Maybe forty of fifty stars in total.
M26,Lester,Lester,6/28/23,11:55 PM,VG,2.5,20mm,There are four bright stars that form a diamond with faint emerging dots of light surrounding them.
M27*,Lester,Lester,6/27/23,11:25 PM,VG,3.5,20mm,"A squarish blob of dull light. Almost forms a ""Z"". Slightly brighter on the bottom. Definitely looks like a dumbbell. Thick, milky, large."
M28,Lester,Lester,6/27/23,12:05 AM,VG,4,20mm,"A pretty, small globular cluster. No individual stars resolved. Very soft. Circular. Spherical"
M29,Lester,Lester,6/27/23,11:50 PM,VG,3.5,20mm,A very wimpy cluster. Maybe 7 or 8 bright stars. The background is already populated with stars. This is a hard to distinguish cluster amongst a field of stars. A few faint dots of light in the background
M30,35.0118938,-87.1463868,7/11/23,12:10 AM,VG,5,20mm,"Circular globular cluster. Boring. Normal, medium sized. No stars resolvable really. Maybe some stars near the middle. Weirdly shaped. The center doesn't look completely circular on further view. Bright grey bulb in the sky"

M39,Lester,Lester,6/27/23,11:55 PM,VG,3.5,20mm,Very large and bright star cluster that is extremely spread out. Hard to distinguish from the populated star field around the object. Takes of the entire field of view in a 20mm eye piece
M40,34.9837014,-87.1687638,2/28/23,10:30 PM,G,3,15mm,"Two close in proximity and magnitude stars. Accompanied by a widely separated ""pair"" of stars at an off angle next to a bright star next to the brightest star in the sequence which is the base of the tail of the bear. No other stars super close to M40"

M42,34.749469,-86.512399,3/4/23,7:50 PM,VG,3,15mm,Very large cloud that appears to be illuminated by stars behind it. Cluster of four stars at tip of large bulge. Faint see-through cotton transitions to dark connton. Reminds me of the continent of Europe in shape. M43 in view
M43,34.749469,-86.512399,3/4/23,8:00 PM,VG,3,15mm,"Across an expanse from M42, tipped by four stars, to a circular looking island. Faint cotton transitions sharply to dark. Almost Florida shaped"

M51,Lester,Lester,3/13/23,10:30 PM,G,4,20mm,"Very large swirl with a smaller companion next to it. Not sure if I'm imagining the bands of the large circular bloom or not. Large and small blooms of equal magnitude. Seems to be a bright light emerging under the large swirl. Large swirl is very wide. Both have bright, pea-like centers. Acclimation to the night vision is a must. Averted vision to get glimpses of bands"
M52,34.9837014,-87.1687638,2/12/23,8:30 PM,VG,4,15mm,Small cluster of 20 to 30 stars. Lower magnitude. One obvious higher magnitude. The rest appear to be around the same. Compact

M55*,Lester 2,Lester 2,7/10/23,11:35 PM,VG,5,20mm,A gigantic coarse globular cluster. Resolvable stars all of about the same magnitude. Very nice. Very spread out but still together. Milky background.
M56,Lester,Lester,5/24/23,11:10 PM,G,3,15mm,"Large and somewhat faint globular cluster. Hard to resolve any stars. Could seem large because it is faint. Hard to spot with bad night vision, a decently bright moon, and mosquitos."
M57*,Lester,Lester,5/24/23,11:00 PM,G,3,15mm,Ring nebula. Awesome. Small ring. First appeared as a small badly resolved star. Requires a bit of focus. A clear ring. Cheerio.
M58,Lester,Lester,3/28/23,11:20 PM,VG,3,20mm,Moon is nearly half so I feel I'm not getting the full impression. Moderately large core. Sort of elongated. Brightness fades slowly. Star of roughly equal magnitude nearby.
M59,Lester,Lester,3/28/23,11:30 PM,VG,3,20mm,Slightly elongated. Bright pea-like core. Small. M60 and other object in view with 20mm eyepiece.

M64,Lester,Lester,3/29/23,11:00 PM,G,3,15mm,Bright. Irregularly shaped. Sort of like an oval. Almost star-like center. Brightness dissipates in the length of the oval. Maintains brightness in those directions respectably.
M65,Lester,Lester,2/27/23,10:00 PM,VG,3,20mm,Elongated bloom. Close to M66. In field of view with 20mm eye piece. Seems to be about the same size as M66. Maybe somewhat smaller. One faint star near it.

M73,Lester 2,Lester 2,7/11/23,12:00 AM,VG,5,20mm,"Three little stars in a triangle. Kind of stands out. I knew I was looking for an asterism but I didn't know what it looked like. I figured this might be what it was. I had to look up to confirm it was indeed these stars. I can make out four stars. It initially looked like three. Small, close group of four stars"
